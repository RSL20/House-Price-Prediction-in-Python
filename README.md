  Predicting-Housing-Prices-using-Advanced-Regression
  
  There are several factors that inﬂuence the price a buyer is willing to pay for a house. Some are apparent and obvious and some are not. Nevertheless, a rational approach facilitated by machine learning can be very useful in predicting the house price. A large data set with 79 diﬀerent features (like living area, number of rooms, location etc) along with their prices are provided for residential homes in Ames, Iowa. The challenge is to learn a relationship between the important features and the price and use it to predict the prices of a new set of houses.

  The goal of this Project was to use EDA, Visualization, Data cleaning, Preprocessing and Linear models to predict home prices given the features of the home and interpret your linear models to find out what features add value to a home.
